What is it?
---

My Mixer is a revolutionary program that allows you to add your own personal touches to your favorite songs. By using a Myo ArmBand and its included SDK, we can:

  - Change Pitch of a track
  - Increase and decrease the speed of a track
 
---

###How does it work
We used four of the total five gestures of the myo in our mixer:

###Pitch Control
 Make a fist and rotate your wrist clockwise. The pitch of the track will rise. Go counterclockwise to lower the pitch.

###Speed Control
Spread your fingers out and move right to increase the speed of the track, or left to decrease the speed of the track.

###End Recording
My Mix records the track you're mixing by default. To end the track and save the recording, double tap your middle finger and thumb together.
